# Graphical-Digit-Recognizer
Uses a convolutional neural network as well as WebGL to create a graphical digit recognizer where users can draw digits using the mouse.

This demo does handwritten digit recognition by evaluating a
Convolutional Neural Network on the GPU with WebGL. The network was
trained in TensorFlow, and the network was then
reimplemented on the GPU by hand with WebGL.

# To Run

```bash
npm install
```

To then run the demo, do

```bash
npm run start
```

Enjoy!
